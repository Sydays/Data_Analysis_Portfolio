# Project Background

Next Check is an e-commerce website that sells a large variety of items. It is the new year and stakeholders what to increase sales for Q2. They request to see what items they should offer more of and if improvements to delivery speeds will increase sales. This project transforms raw data into clear visuals that are ready to assist in business development.

## Data Structure

This database was messy with duplicates, incorrect data types, and inconsistent wording. The data was structured with multiple tables containing specific information on various corners of the company. The database held around 90,000 records. The data were cleaned, explored and brought to life using SQL.

## Executive Summery 

  Next Check generated approximately $24 million in revenue, curated by 89,000 orders. Customers on average spent $268.00 per order. Sales peaked in August, followed by a decline as the company approaches Q4. This pattern aligns with the previous year. Based on last year’s trend, revenue is expected to increase by the end of the month. 

Order volume increased following the launch of the Next Day delivery advertising campaign. This generated 564 additional orders. This lets us know that faster delivery influences customer purchasing behavior. 

Toys are the top-preforming product with $17 million in lifetime sales. However, toys also account for the highest return rate, so there is a bit of potential loss that comes with increasing toy stocks. I recommend shifting our focus on toys alongside health/beauty to drive order growth for the next quarter.

Delivery performance has shown noticeable improvement, with 92% of orders arriving earlier than the estimated delivery date. Approximately 6% of orders are delivered late. By looking at the average delivery time map, a handful of locations have 15 – 20-day delivery. Targeting which locations have the highest times and making the decision to increase the number of delivery routes in that location could significantly reduce the 6,000 late orders.
