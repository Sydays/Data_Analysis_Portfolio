# Project Background 
Mpress is an e-commerce company specializing in custom printed products. The company runs multiple ad campaigns which vary in performance.As the company is entering Q1, stakeholders are seeking insights on which campaigns the company should create, continue, or end. This project transforms a unstructured database into clear insights, using SQL and PowerBI.

## Data Structure 
This database consisted of one table with multiple datatypes. This was a smaller database, only containing 2000 records. The database given was messy with NULL values, inconsistent wording, and incorrect date/time formatting. This was corrected by multiple SQL queries to clean the data.

## Executive Summary 
 Over the past year, our total impressions reached 76.3 million, while conversions peaked at 288,000. Although we have a strong hold on our target audience, there is a large opportunity for improvements on user retention to increase conversion rates. 
 
To achieve this, I recommend conducting a deeper evaluation of underperforming campaigns. Analyzing our past launches , such as the Q2/Q3 summer campaign and our Black Friday Campaigns should reveal key factors that are limiting growth. 
On the other hand, high-preforming campaigns such as 	CMP00230 generated 99.5k impressions and 461 conversions. Going over these top launches will provide valuable information on effective strategies.

By scaling these attributes, we can have a better understanding of the user’s perspective. Combining these improvement and pushing our upcoming projects through Facebook and TikTok will drive stronger conversion rates for the new year.
